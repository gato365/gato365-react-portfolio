What are the main parts on the react app?
    
    1. Components - reusable pieces of code that return HTML
    2. State - data that changes over time
    3. Props - data that is passed from parent to child
    4. Lifecycle - methods that are called at different stages of the component's life
    5. Events - actions that happen when a user interacts with the app
    6. Hooks - functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class
    7. Context - a way to share data between components without having to pass props down manually at every level
    8. Router - a way to navigate between different pages in an app
    9. Redux - a state management library that allows you to manage the state of your app in one place


    10. JSX - a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML in React
    12. JSX-Expressions - a way to write JavaScript inside of JSX
    11. Babel - a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript into older versions of JavaScript that all browsers can understand
